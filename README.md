# live-eq
React component for live audio frequencies
i started learning guitar, and i learned theres this thing called fundemental frequency, and many frequencies after that in the same string. so i wanted to check the fundementals and the followings. so i went to garage band to open up an eq, but it crashed never to return again. i looked online for an eq to test my guitar, but couldnt find one. so theres this.
this app can also save your current live frequencies and than you can compare between 2 strings or sounds. theres also a limitless range you can zoom on or out.
